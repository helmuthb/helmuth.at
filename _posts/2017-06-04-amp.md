I wanted to learn more about [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org) - the
initiative started by Google to create an open standard for mobile
versions of websites.

AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages, and the idea is that a
webpage can provide a mobile-optimized version.
But when looking at what is possible with AMP I realized that it
is more than sufficient for my blog.

So instead of having a mobile-optimized version for a page, each
page itself is mobile-optimized.

This requires some tweaking: for example, each image must use
a tag called ```amp-img``` instead of a regular ```img```-tag.
To make my life easier, I added some filters to perform the required
conversion automatically.
