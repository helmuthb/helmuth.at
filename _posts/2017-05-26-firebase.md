This blog is powered by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) hosting.

You probably associate the name Firebase with the realtime database
product, or maybe with the mobile-related toolset announced at
Google I/O 2016.

Firebase hosting is one of the less known parts of the Firebase family.
It offers 1GB of free storage for your webspace, with a transfer limit
of 10GB per month.
In addition Firebase will deploy your site with a free SSL certificate,
and it will be served also via HTTP/2.

I have combined this hosting in my setup with [GitHub](https://github.com)
for storing the source code, and with [Codeship](https://codeship.com)
for "compiling" the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) source into plain HTML,
whenever I perform a commit.

And should I be on the road without a PC for blogging, I can use
[Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com) which gives me a GUI
for adding posts or making changes, which will be automatically
committed to GitHub.
