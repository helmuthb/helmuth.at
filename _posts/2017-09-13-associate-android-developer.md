Just recently I took the _Associate Android Developer Certification_.

I'm collecting my experience with it - what it is, how it works, and how you can prepare for this certification.

What it is
==========

As Google describes it on their introduction video:
> An achievement available to those who can display the skills of an entry-level Android developer.

The certificate is a _performance-based certification_, meaning that
you have to perform real Android development work for passing the
certification.

You have sufficient time for performing the tasks, you can use all resources at your disposal (including Stack Overflow, the Android documentation, and other resources on the Internet).
This is aiming to correspond to real work situation. When working as an Android developer you won't have to answer multiple-choice questions or solve problems without the help of Internet resources, and the exam wants to mimic this.

How it works
============
The exam itself consists of two parts.
The first part is working on an existing skeleton Android application, completing functionality and adding missing features.
You download the skeleton on your development machine, read through the list of tasks to be done, and then start working on it.
The clock is ticking - you have to submit your work within 24 hours, or your attempt has failed.

A few days after submitting your solution you will be invited to make an appointment for the exit interview.
Expect some questions about the project you did, the difficult parts it contained, and some generic Android development related questions.
In essence they want to double-check that it was _you_ who has worked on the submission, and that you do have a basic knowledge about the structure of Android development.

Before the Exam
---------------

As the first step, you will have to pay for the exam. It currently costs 149 US$, and includes up to three attempts.

Once you submit your payment you are usually able to start immediately with the first part of the exam.
_Usually_ - in my case they had some technical issues and I had to wait a week before the exam code was available. In exchange, they gave me a 50 US$ discount - _thank you, Google!_

The exam is actually taken by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com), so don't be surprised to be paying to and downloading the exam from Udacity and not a Google website.
This makes sense, as Udacity has already some extensive infrastructure for evaluating and grading code submissions by students, parts of which they could use for the Google certification.

During the Exam
---------------

They start off with an invented scenario - your colleague who started on the app had to leave the team, and within 24 hours you should finish it now.
_It sounds silly, but I invite you to immerse into the scenario, this can help you being in the right mood for performing the tasks._

The tasks for the performance-based part of the exam are to fix some bugs, implement Android tests, and add missing views, activities, and features.

Everything is very well described on a website, the missing views are shown as screenshots (no ambiguous mock-ups), and with some Android development experience you should not find it difficult to perform the requested tasks.

All the usual resources are at your disposal: Android Studio with all its tricks (including Espresso Test Recorder), the Android documentation, Stack Overflow, and any resource on the Internet.
However, should you copy parts from such external resources you should give them credit in source code comments.

You can use external components, libraries, and plugins. Still, all tasks can be easily accomplished without any additional tools besides what is delivered in Android Studio.

From the time you start the exam you have 24 hours to submit your work. There won't be any flexibility on the timeline, so you really should submit it better one hour early so that in case of Internet issues you can resolve them.

Don't worry too much about the time given. Depending on your experience you will probably finish within 8 hours or much less.

Exit Interview
--------------

A few days after you submitted you should receive an email that it has been graded, and hopefully an invitation to take the exit interview.
In my case, I received it four days after the exam.

You can then schedule the exit interview for one of the next days. As the slots are limited, you might have to choose a day two or three days after your invitation.
The exit interview will use a webcam and will be performed via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
I suggest you to test the link in advance before your appointment, to download the require Zoom plugin / application and to test your setup.

You won't see your interviewer. So it is a one-way video channel. _At least this was the case for me._

The interview itself takes about 15 minutes.

It started with asking me about details of the application for the exam and my experience, and then went on with very generic Android development related questions.
All questions were very easy and with some Android development experience you should feel at ease answering them.

Your Certificate
----------------

After the interview you will be told that you did it and that you can expect your certificate in a separate email, usually within one week. As of today I am still waiting for the certificate itself, it should arrive early next week.

You will receive an email with a link which you can put on e.g. [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) or your email signature.

However, you won't receive anything tangible. It's all bits and bytes on the Internet, no _real_ stuff.

The certificate is valid for three years. After that you would have to re-take it, to show that you are up-to-date with modern Android development trends.

Questions & Content
===================

You should have a _basic_ knowledge and some existing development experience for the following areas:
* Android Activities & Fragments
* Background Services, Broadcast Receivers
* SQLite database, SharedPreferences
* XML-based layout files
* Styles & Themes
* RecyclerView & Adapters
* Custom Views

The level of knowlegde and experience needed is really basic.
As mentioned, you have the Internet for looking up details, but you should know the concepts and have done some work with them before.

Should you Take It?
===================

If you want to work as an Android Developer it is definitely a valuable part for your CV.
It shows some basic knowledge and experience, and since it is from Google it will easily receive recognition with potential employers.

Other things you can (and should) do is to add some Android projects on your GitHub profile.
And having one or two apps on the Google Play Store is never wrong.

_Good Luck!_
