Two years I started with a blog based on WordPress.

WordPress is a great start for creating a blog.
The requirements (PHP, MySQL) are offered by almost every web hoster,
and there are templates for almost everything.
Blogging is easy, and there are mobile apps as well as bookmarklets
which make keeping your blog up to date.

But at the end I didn't really like it.

This is a new attempt using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
With Jekyll the blog is written in Markdown (or other markup languages),
"compiled" to HTML, and the static content is uploaded.
This process has some clear advantages:
* Hosting does not need _any_ server-side stuff, no database, no scripting
* The website source code is stored as text files, easy to version-control

There are less templates for Jekyll, but then creating your own Jekyll
template to generate the HTML code of your liking is not difficult and
makes quite some fun.
